## Completed Phases

### Foundation Epics (Epics 1–10) ✅

All ten foundation epics have been executed and are stable.

| Epic | Title | Key Outcomes |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Lock the monorepo architecture | Ownership zones defined; boundary, dependency, and shipping-separation rules documented |
| 2 | Restructure the repo physically | Atlas, NovaForge, AtlasAI, Shared directories established; code migrated to correct zones |
| 3 | Stand up the bridge backbone | `AtlasBridgeContract` shared types; bridge transport model documented; NovaForge integration scaffolded |
| 4 | Wire the first usable endpoints | `/project/info`, `/editor/selection`, `/build/run`, `/editor/tools/run` operational |
| 5 | Refactor NovaForge into callable modules | Monolithic startup split; project context isolated; editor tool hooks separated |
| 6 | Refactor Arbiter → AtlasAI | Folder rename complete; all C++/C#/CMake/docs updated |
| 7 | Build system cleanup | CMake structure updated; AtlasAI optional; editor/tooling separated from shipping |
| 8 | Safety, logging, and operational controls | Action allowlist; dry-run defaulted true; audit logging; local trust guard |
| 9 | First real workflow milestone | AtlasAI reads project info, queries editor state, launches safe build, runs safe editor tool |
| 10 | Second-wave improvements | Search roots; richer editor snapshots; codegen proposal workflow; workspace dashboard |

---

## Logging Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

Proper logging wired into every executable and runnable component across the project.

### Shared Logging Utilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Scripts/Logging/log_helper.sh` | Bash library sourced by all shell scripts — `log_init` creates a timestamped log file and tees all stdout+stderr; `log_section` emits labelled dividers |
| `Shared/Logging/MasterLogger.h` | C++17 header-only singleton — dual console+file output, five severity levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL), thread-safe, ISO 8601 timestamps, convenience macros `MR_LOG_*` |
| `Shared/Logging/log_utils.py` | Python utility for tools outside AtlasAI — `get_tool_logger(name, subsystem)` creates rotating file + console handler under `Logs/<subsystem>/` |

### Log Directory Layout

## Near-Term Goals (Active)

### Phase 11 — Engine C++ Subsystem Expansion ✅ COMPLETE

The C++ source files are now in place. The next step is wiring them into the CMake build graph and verifying each subsystem compiles and links correctly.

- [x] Wire `Atlas/Engine/Rendering/` into `AtlasEngine` CMake target
- [x] Wire `Atlas/Engine/Scene/` + `Atlas/Engine/Scripting/` into target — `SceneNode`, `SceneGraph`, `SceneManager` scaffolded and wired
- [x] Wire `Atlas/Editor/Core/`, `Input/`, `Camera/`, `Selection/`, `Outliner/`, `Inspector/`, `Gizmos/` into `AtlasEditor` target
- [x] Wire `Atlas/Editor/Panels/` + `Atlas/Editor/EditorServices/AI/` into `AtlasEditor` target
- [x] Add `Atlas/Editor/Framework/UI/` (`UIThemeManager`, `UIWidgetRegistry`) to `AtlasEditor` target
- [x] Resolve any missing includes from external deps (glm, stb, etc.) — `Atlas/Engine/Config/ExternalDepsManifest.h` documents all resolved paths
- [x] Run full engine build smoke test — `Scripts/Build/smoke_test_engine_build.py` (26/26 checks pass)

### Phase 12 — NovaForge Client/Server CMake Wiring ✅ COMPLETE

The server and client source trees are populated. Next: integrate with the CMake build.

- [x] Wire `NovaForge/Client/App/` into `NovaForgeApp` CMake target — `NovaForge/Client/CMakeLists.txt` created
- [x] Wire `NovaForge/Client/App/shaders/` into shader compile step — listed as INTERFACE resources in Client CMake
- [x] Wire `NovaForge/Server/tests/` test suite into CTest — `NovaForge/Server/CMakeLists.txt` registers all `test_*.cpp` via CTest
- [x] Verify `NovaForge/Client/App/external/` (tinygltf, nlohmann/json, stb, tinyobjloader) — INTERFACE include targets wired
- [x] Add server config/whitelist validation — `server_config.json` + `server_config.schema.json` added

### Phase 13 — AtlasAI Live Integration ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Live viewport attachment (`supportsViewportAttach` capability) — `LiveViewportClient` in `live/live_viewport.py`
- [x] Hot-reload / live patch workflow (`supportsLivePatch`) — `HotReloadCoordinator` in `live/hot_reload.py`
- [x] Multi-workspace support (parallel bridge sessions) — `MultiWorkspaceManager` in `live/multi_workspace.py`
- [x] Expand codegen loop to accept diffs from AI-proposed changes — `CodegenDiffRelay` in `live/codegen_diff_relay.py`
- [x] PythonBridge → WebSocket event relay for real-time build streaming — `BuildStreamRelay` in `live/build_stream_relay.py`

### Phase 14 — Testing & CI Hardening ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Add unit tests for all bridge endpoint handlers (ProjectService, EditorService, BuildService) — `test_phase14_bridge_endpoints.py`
- [x] Add integration tests that spin up the FastAPI bridge and exercise each endpoint — `test_phase14_bridge_integration.py` (28 tests, TestClient)
- [x] Add TypeScript Jest coverage for WebhookIntegration — `tests/server.test.ts`, `webhook-security.test.ts`, `logger.test.ts` (43 Jest tests)
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions CI: pytest pipeline — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` added
- [x] Add schema validation tests (JSON round-trip against `Shared/ToolProtocol/schemas/`) — `test_phase14_schema_validation.py`
- [x] Automate audit log rotation and workspace snapshot exports — `audit_log_rotation.py` + `test_phase14_audit_rotation.py`

### Phase 15 — Character + Gameplay Loop Hookup ✅ Done

- [x] Connect `CharacterSystem` to `PlayerController` (movement mode dispatch) — `PlayerControllerHookup`
- [x] Connect `EquipmentSystem` to mining tool interaction (`ToolInteractionShell`) — `EquipmentToolBridge`
- [x] Wire `IKSystem` into character animation pipeline — `IKAnimationBridge`
- [x] Wire `FPSPresentationSystem` into runtime rendering — `FPSRenderingBridge`
- [x] Connect `CharacterEditorSystem` to editor mode controller — `CharacterEditorBridge`
- [x] Add `MechPossessionSystem` vehicle entry/exit events to gameplay loop — `MechGameplayBridge`
- [x] Connect `GameOrchestrator` boot path to `NovaForgeBootstrap` — `GameOrchestratorBoot`
- [x] Wire `SaveManager` into world serialization — `SaveManagerHookup`
- [x] Wire `RuntimeUIShell` into HUD display path — `RuntimeUIHookup`

### Phase 16 — Long-Term Vision Scaffold 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- [x] Document Phase 16A–16D plan — `Docs/Architecture/phase16_long_term_vision.md`
- [x] `ExternalDepsManifest.h` — compile-time registry of all third-party dep paths
- [x] `Scripts/Build/smoke_test_engine_build.py` — pre-build health check script
- [ ] Phase 16A: IDE diff panel + human-in-the-loop approval flow
- [ ] Phase 16B: MultiWorkspaceManager integration with Atlas IDE shell
- [ ] Phase 16C: PCG builder second-wave actions + preview mesh generation
- [ ] Phase 16D: GitHub Actions release workflow → Inno Setup installer artifact

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Full Codegen Workflow

Human-in-the-loop AI code generation: AtlasAI proposes a change → diff is shown in the IDE → user approves → patch is applied. The codegen planner (Epic 10) is the foundation; Phases 13–14 complete the loop. See `Docs/Architecture/phase16_long_term_vision.md` for the implementation plan.

### Multi-Workspace & Multi-Project Support

A single AtlasAI instance managing multiple concurrent project workspaces, each with an independent bridge session. Atlas engine work and NovaForge game work managed from one shell.

### Expanded PCG & Builder Tooling

The `BuilderToolActionId` second-wave actions provide scaffolding for deep PCG integration — preview mesh generation, builder entity validation, diagnostics — all accessible from AtlasAI without leaving the workspace.

### Shipping & Distribution

The Inno Setup installer (`AtlasAI/Installer/atlasai_setup.iss`) bundles the full AtlasAI stack into a single Windows `.exe`. Long-term: automated CI build of the installer on every tagged release.

### NovaForge Public Release

Once the engine, editor, and game systems are production-ready, NovaForge ships as a standalone title. The Atlas engine and AtlasAI tooling remain open source; the game content follows a separate distribution model.
